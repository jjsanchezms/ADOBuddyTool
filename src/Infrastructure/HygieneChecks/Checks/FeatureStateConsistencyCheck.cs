/// <summary>
/// Analyzes state consistency between Release Trains and their related/child Features.
/// 
/// This check identifies potential project management issues by detecting misaligned states:
/// 
/// State Analysis:
/// - Categorizes Features into New, Active, and Completed buckets
/// - Calculates completion rate across all related Features
/// - Identifies inconsistencies with Release Train state
/// 
/// Consistency Rules:
/// - Release Trains marked as "Done/Closed/Completed" should have â‰¥80% Features completed
/// - Release Trains in "New/Proposed" state shouldn't have active or completed Features
/// - Warns when Release Train state doesn't reflect actual Feature progress
/// 
/// This helps project managers identify:
/// - Release Trains marked complete prematurely
/// - Stale Release Train states that need updating
/// - Potential planning or tracking issues
