# ADOBuddyTool

A C# .NET 8 console application that generates roadmaps from Azure DevOps Feature work items and automatically creates Release Train work items following SOLID principles.

## Overview

This application connects to Azure DevOps, retrieves Feature work items from a specified area path, processes special title patterns to create Release Trains, and generates roadmaps that can be exported to JSON, CSV, or displayed in the console.

## Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles with a layered structure:

- **Domain/**: Core business entities, value objects, and domain services
  - `Entities/`: Domain models (WorkItem, RoadmapItem, ReleaseTrainSummary)
  - `Services/`: Domain service interfaces and implementations
  - `ValueObjects/`: Immutable value objects
- **Application/**: Application layer with commands and error handling
  - `Commands/`: Command handlers for different operations
  - `ErrorHandling/`: Centralized error management
- **Infrastructure/**: External concerns and service implementations
  - `AzureDevOps/`: Azure DevOps API integration with interfaces and services
  - `HygieneChecks/`: Health and quality assessment implementations
  - `Output/`: Output formatting and export services
  - `Roadmap/`: Roadmap generation and Release Train creation logic
- **Presentation/**: Application entry point and configuration
  - `Program.cs`: Main application entry point
  - `Configuration/`: Configuration classes (AzureDevOpsOptions, AppOptions)
  - `DependencyInjection/`: Service container and DI configuration

## Configuration

Update `appsettings.json` with your Azure DevOps details:

```json
{
  "AzureDevOps": {
    "Organization": "your-organization",
    "Project": "your-project",
    "PersonalAccessToken": "your-pat-token"
  }
}
```

### Getting a Personal Access Token

1. Go to Azure DevOps > User Settings > Personal Access Tokens
2. Create a new token with "Work Items (Read & Write)" permissions
3. Copy the token to your configuration

## Release Train Creation

The application automatically processes Feature work items with special title patterns to create Release Train work items:

### Pattern Format
- Use titles like: `----- Release Train Name -----rt`
- To update an existing Release Train: `----- Release Train Name -----rt:12345` (where 12345 is the existing work item ID)
- End the group with: `------------`

### Automatic Error Recovery
**NEW FEATURE**: When a Feature references a non-existent Release Train ID (e.g., `----- GCCH -----rt:4160082` where Release Train #4160082 doesn't exist), the application will:

1. **Automatically create a new Release Train** instead of failing
2. **Update the Feature title** with the new Release Train ID (e.g., `----- GCCH -----rt:4170000`)
3. **Log the recovery operation** for transparency
4. **Continue processing** without interruption

This ensures data integrity and prevents broken references while maintaining the intended Release Train structure.

### Example
```
Feature 1: ----- Q1 2024 Release -----rt
Feature 2: User Authentication
Feature 3: Payment Gateway
Feature 4: Reporting Dashboard
Feature 5: ------------
```

This will create a Release Train called "Q1 2024 Release" with Features 2, 3, and 4 as child items.

### Error Recovery Example
```
Feature 1: ----- GCCH -----rt:4160082    # Non-existent Release Train ID
Feature 2: Data Migration
Feature 3: API Updates
Feature 4: ------------
```

**Result:**
- ‚ùå Release Train #4160082 doesn't exist
- üîÑ Creates new Release Train #4170000 instead
- ‚úÖ Updates Feature 1 title to: `----- GCCH -----rt:4170000`
- ‚úÖ Links Features 2 and 3 to the new Release Train

## Usage

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Display help
ADOBuddyTool --help

# Basic roadmap generation (required area path parameter)
ADOBuddyTool --area-path "SPOOL\\Resource Provider" --roadmap

# Run ADO hygiene checks
ADOBuddyTool --area-path "SPOOL\\Resource Provider" --ado-hygiene

# Update SWAG values for Release Trains (auto-generated only)
ADOBuddyTool --area-path "SPOOL\\Resource Provider" --swag-auto-generated

# Update SWAG values for ALL Release Trains (auto-generated and manual)
ADOBuddyTool --area-path "SPOOL\\Resource Provider" --swag-all

# Combine multiple operations
ADOBuddyTool --area-path "SPOOL\\Resource Provider" --roadmap --ado-hygiene

# Use quiet mode for automation
ADOBuddyTool --area-path "SPOOL\\Resource Provider" --swag-auto-generated --quiet

# Use verbose mode for detailed output
ADOBuddyTool --area-path "SPOOL\\Resource Provider" --roadmap --verbose

# Process more work items
ADOBuddyTool --area-path "MyProject\\MyTeam" --swag-auto-generated --limit 200
```

### Operations

- `--roadmap`: Generate roadmap and create Release Train work items from patterns
- `--ado-hygiene`: Run ADO hygiene checks on Release Trains and Features  
- `--swag-auto-generated`: Review Release Trains and manage SWAG calculations (auto-generated only)
- `--swag-all`: Update SWAG for ALL Release Trains (auto-generated and manual)
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose output (detailed logging and progress information)
- `--quiet`: Enable quiet mode (minimal output, errors only)

### SWAG Updates Operation

The `--swag-auto-generated` operation provides intelligent SWAG (effort estimation) management for Release Trains using the status notes field:

#### For Auto-Generated Release Trains:
- **Automatically updates** the Release Train's SWAG value in status notes to match the sum of all related Features
- **Ensures consistency** between Release Train planning and actual Feature effort
- **Uses `[SWAG: value]` prefix** in the status notes field to store SWAG information

#### For Manual Release Trains:
- **Normal mode** (`--swag-auto-generated`): Shows warnings when SWAG doesn't match Feature sum, preserves manual values
- **ALL mode** (`--swag-all`): Updates ALL Release Trains regardless of auto-generated tag
- **Validates** that the Release Train SWAG in status notes matches the sum of related Features
- **Shows warnings** when there are mismatches to help identify planning discrepancies

#### Example Output:
```
üìä Release Train #12345: 'Q1 2024 Platform Updates'
   Auto-generated: Yes
   Related Features: 5 (4 with SWAG, 1 without)
   Current RT SWAG (from status notes): 8
   Calculated SWAG: 13
   üîÑ Updating SWAG in status notes from 8 to 13

üìä Release Train #12346: 'Manual Planning Release'
   Auto-generated: No
   Related Features: 3 (3 with SWAG, 0 without)   Current RT SWAG (from status notes): 15
   Calculated SWAG: 12
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Release Train SWAG in status notes (15) does not match sum of Features (12)
```

#### SWAG Storage Format:
SWAG values are stored as a prefix in the Release Train's status notes field using the format:
```
[SWAG: 70]This is the original status notes content
```

#### Benefits:
- **Automated effort tracking** for auto-generated Release Trains
- **Planning validation** for manual Release Trains
- **Visibility** into Features missing SWAG estimates
- **Data consistency** across Release Train hierarchies
- **Non-intrusive storage** using status notes field with clear prefix format
